Recent commits:
ed931ac Removed root path config and settled on moving the live dashboard to its own sub-path `/monitor`.  Also renamed `job_server` to `workers`
6ead98f Created release with configurable root path and fixed prod execution script
4d12317 Updated prod execution script.  Cannot have two bash `exec` commands.  Migrations are now executed without `exec` (i.e. in a sub-shell) before the phoenix server started in a replaced shell (via exec)
eaf5d91 Made root path configurable since app is deployed in a subdirectory in prod.  Loosely followed guidelines here:  https://geoffreylessel.com/2016/hosting-a-phoenix-app-in-a-subdirectory-with-nginx/
